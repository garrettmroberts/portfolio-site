      "Are you ever indecisive about what you want to eat? WeGusta makes the choice easier by letting you choose cuisine types using a Tinder-like interface. Based on your input, it will recommend a highly rated local restaurant that fits your criteria!  This app is built using React Native and the Google Maps API.  The animations were challenging to build and it was a fun project to work on.",
